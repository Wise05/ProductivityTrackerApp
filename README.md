# Productivity Tracker App

This app tracks user key strokes (enters, spaces, and clicks) and then compiles them into graphs to show the user at what time they were being the most productive. 

It only works on my computer because I didn't code any directory config for it to work on other windows machines. 

The rest of this read me will showcase what I did, and some of my findings I found after tracking myself daily for a single month of school.


<b>As of now I am facing a bug where the program stops listening to my key strokes. Also, it takes up a lot of my CPU usage.</b>
